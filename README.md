# angular-nyc-ngrx-store

This is the demo app built for a talk given at [Angular NYC Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/AngularNYC/events/234776441/) (Oct 2016).
This shows how [ngrx/store](https://github.com/ngrx/store/) can be used to do client-side state management in [Angular 2](https://angular.io) apps.
